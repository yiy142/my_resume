\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
\item Helped store and organize children's drawing collected from iPads in museums into lab's server
\item Developed a jpg to csv file parser to extract meta data such as age, class and date
\item Developed a gallery website with sorting and filtering features using React.js
\item Upon professor manually marked a drawing as "invalid doodling", send queries to MongoDB so that we would not include these outliers in future training models
\end{itemize}

{\bf Triton Robotics}, Computer Vision Engineer Intern
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
\item Developed contour detection to recognize enemy robots on camera using OpenCV
\item Developed object detection to shoot each blade of the Power Rune (five-blade fan) using Scipy Convolve, accuracy around 99\%, run-time 5sec
\item Tested YOLO v3 deep-learning frame, run-time significantly reduced, detection accuracy 99\%
\end{itemize}

{\bf Activity Tracker Slack Bot(JayJay Team Project)}, Coder
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
\item Professor wants a real time Slack Bot to keep track of students' attendance in his lectures
